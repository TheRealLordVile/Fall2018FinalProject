# DEVELOPMENT
## WEEK 1:
Added the background image, pacman and the pixel formation of the game in the form of a 2D Vector. I added some sample sounds as well to test if it was working and put it on an infinite loop, but the transition isn't seamless right now, need to tweak the sound file.
## WEEK 2:
Structured the program better and made the whole project more object oriented. Started adding movement to pacman. Created folders for images and sounds and accesed them using relative paths in the code.
