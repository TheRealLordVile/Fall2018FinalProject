# DEVELOPMENT
## WEEK 1:
Added the background image, pacman and the pixel formation of the game in the form of a 2D Vector. I added some sample sounds as well to test if it was working and put it on an infinite loop, but the transition isn't seamless right now, need to tweak the sound file.
## WEEK 2:
Structured the program better and made the whole project more object oriented. Started adding movement to pacman. Created folders for images and sounds and accesed them using relative paths in the code.
## WEEK 3:
Movement works perfectly now. Pacman is able to pickup coins and the number of coins picked up can be seen in the pause screen. Added the start screen and the buttons work as well. Made the sounds more seamless and added some sounds that only work when pacman moves.
## WEEK 4:
Now the game ends when all coins are picked up. Implemented ghosts that have random movement and pacman dies when he touches them. The game also ends when pacman loses all of his lives (3 at the start). The game includes different levels that get harder by increasing the number of ghosts (up to 5). Added graphic parts for ending and leaderboard screen. Started using json files to store different layouts and the top scores.
