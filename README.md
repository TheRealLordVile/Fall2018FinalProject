# FinalProject README
Only tested on xcode 10 might not work on other c++ environments, including other versions of xcode.
Sounds and Images used in the project do NOT belong to me and are used for educational purposes only.

## Installation:
The latest version of openframeworks is required for installation. Open the openframeworks director and click on project generator and then open the project generator app. Click "Create/Update" after opening the app. Find the directory of the finalProject file and use it as the path and the game should open in xcode automatically.
## Details about Gameplay:
W,A,S,D buttons are used to move pacman Up, Left, Down and Right in order. Pressing P while the game continues pauses the game and shows the number of lives left. Ghosts move unexpectedly and will move at the same speed as pacman. The number of ghosts increase with each level and are capped at 5 starting from level 4. A leaderboard that lasts through different games exists and keep tracks of the highest 10 scores. A small easter egg exists on level 4 and afterwards.
