# Project Proposal
## Overall Idea
I wish to create a pac-man game[http://www.freepacman.org/] in openframeworks as my final project for cs126 with some added functionality.
## Description Of The Game
I aim to create the pac-man game as it is. I wosh to have a top scores board and implement a two player system as an extension of the project. Two players will have a set number of lives and will try to outlive the other while earning as many points as they can by eating food. If all the food on one level is eaten then the game will go to the next level, which will just have the npc ghosts move faster and maybe smarter. The game will have a set number of levels and if both players survive them, then the game ends and their scores are compared. I can save the score in a file for top scores but it's not mandatory. Players will enter their names for their top scores so that the score is stored with the name.
